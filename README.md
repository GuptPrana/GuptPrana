## Hello World!

My name is Pranav, and I'm an Electronics and Computer Engineering student at HKUST.

I generally get my thrills trying new things, which has landed me trouble several times. However, this way, I tend to have great conversations on a plethora of topics. Would always be open to a little chat on anything over chai! 

- ðŸ’¬ I'm interested in Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Finance, Wireless Systems, Entrepreneurship, and more!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on Dephonia - A Mobile Platform for Children with Speech Disorders to Accelerate Rehabilitation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Statistical Machine Learning Methods and Model Deployment.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research topics related to Wireless Systems, Internet-of-Things, and Speech Processing.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: guptprana25@gmail.com (no spam please).
- âš¡ Fun fact: Currently Learning Life Lessons Playing Poker and Binge-Watching House MD!
